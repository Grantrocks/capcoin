   "Content": "CapCoin is a cryptocurrency that is very simple and very fast. The whole idea of this project was to make a cryptocurrency that was almost a instant mine and it was secure and there were little transaction fees. I basically created a simplified version of Bitcoin. I created this cryptocurrency from scratch using the programming languages Python,HTML,JS,CSS. It took me a long time to do and I really hope that you enjoy using it. Please do note though that this cryptocurrency is not technically yet a cryptocurrency meaning you cant do much with it but show it off and send it around to friends and family. I will make a shop on the website though were you can buy miners with your CapCoin so that you dont have to constantly press the mine button on the mainpage. Thanks for reading, Grant McNamara"
